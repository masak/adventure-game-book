# Arrays

All the variables we've seen so far have had dollar signs (`$`) up front. We call them *scalar variables*. They are distinguished by the fact that they have room for one value at a time.

    my $greeting = "Hello, World!";
    say $greeting;

Today we'll talk about a new kind of variables, *array variables*, which can contain a sequence of values, and which are written with an at-sign (`@`):

    my @ingredients = "flour", "salt", "sugar", "milk", "eggs", "butter";
    say "To make pancakes, you need these ingredients:";
    say @ingredients.join(" ");  # "flour salt sugar milk eggs butter"

So the variable `@ingredients` contains six things, all string values in this case. But they could easily be numbers, or other kinds of values.

Note that we made use of the method call `.join(" ")` when we wanted to print the array. It makes sure to put a space between each value before printing them. (`.join` takes an array or a list and produces a single string, putting a separator &mdash; `" "` in this case &mdash; between each element.)

Had we just printed the elements, the ingredients would've been harder to read:

    say @ingredients;  # "floursaltsugarmilkeggsbutter"

Try saying that quickly five times. :P

There's also a way to fill up an array element by element:

    my @ingredients;  # created empty
    push @ingredients, "flour";
    push @ingredients, "salt";
    push @ingredients, "sugar";
    push @ingredients, "milk";
    push @ingredients, "eggs";
    push @ingredients, "butter";

And then we can take them out again one by one if we want:

    # we've already done all the push-ing
    say pop @ingredients; # "butter"
    say pop @ingredients; # "eggs"
    say pop @ingredients; # "milk"
    say pop @ingredients; # "sugar"
    say pop @ingredients; # "salt"
    say pop @ingredients; # "flour"

But, hey, look at that! They came out backwards!

That's no coincidence. `push` adds to the end of the array, and `pop` removes from the end of the array. Together they make the array act like a so-called *stack*; think of a stack of plate, where you always add and remove plates at the top.

But surely we could get things out in a non-reversed order if we wanted? Yes, of course:

    # we've already done all the push-ing
    say shift @ingredients; # "butter"
    say shift @ingredients; # "eggs"
    say shift @ingredients; # "milk"
    say shift @ingredients; # "sugar"
    say shift @ingredients; # "salt"
    say shift @ingredients; # "flour"

So, `shift` removes things from the start of the array. Together, `push` and `shift` act like a *queue*, like a line of people waiting for something. You won't get served until all the people ahead of you have been.

To complete the set of operations, there's a fourth one called `unshift` which adds something to the start of the array. That's the least used one.

    unshift ---> +-------+ <--- push
                 | array |
      shift <--- +-------+ ---> pop

                 +-------+ <--- push
                 | stack |
                 +-------+ ---> pop

                 +-------+ <--- push
                 | queue |
      shift <--- +-------+

Finally, there's a way to operate on individual values if we want to:

    my @ingredients = "flour", "salt", "sugar", "milk", "eggs", "butter";
    
    say @ingredients[3];        # "milk" -- keep in mind, we start indexing at 0
    
    @ingredients[3] = "cream";  # ooh, luxury pancakes!
    say @ingredients.join(" "); # "flour salt sugar cream eggs butter"

I don't know about you, but I'm going to make myself some pancakes *right now*. Tomorrow we'll tackle `for` loops.
