# Subroutines

Our programs are getting rather long, and they're all in one piece. Even with `if`s and loops to make it more fun, it's all just one big string of instructions. As our programs keep expanding, that will be harder and harder to maintain.

We need a way to subdivide our programs. Enter the subroutine. (Or, shorter, the "sub".)

    sub miniprogram {  # declare it
        say "Hello.";
        say "I'm a little isolated world of my own.";
        say "And now I'm finished. kthxbai";
    }
    
    miniprogram;       # call it

A legitimate question at this point is: "Why did we do that?" More exactly, what did we gain from putting code inside a subroutine and then calling the subroutine? Isn't it always more straightforward to... not do that?

Well, no. There are at least two good reasons for stowing away code in subroutines:

* We can give pieces of code descriptive names. That's more important than one might think.
* We can call the same piece of code from several different places. That means that we avoid repeating that same stretch of code; instead we just repeat a small subroutine name each time.

Later, there'll be a third good reason, having to do with modules and the sharing of code.

It's worth mentioning two more things about subroutines. First, they can return values:

    sub roll_die {
        return (1..6).roll;
    }
    
    say roll_die;    # and it rolls the die

The `return` there means "exit the sub immediately with the following value". `return`ing with no value is fine, too. You can `return` at the end of a subroutine, or from the middle of it. Whatever value you return becomes the value of the whole sub call. You can take that value, store it in a variable, print it, etc. If you don't have a `return` in your subroutine, the last value in the routine will be returned automatically.

The other thing that's worth knowing is that you can pass things *into* a sub.

    sub add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }
    
    say add(10, 25);    # "35"

Well, that was easy! You just declare a number of *parameters* &mdash; `$a` and `$b` in this case &mdash; and then you can call the subroutine with that many values.

Here's another example:

    sub greet($name) {
        say "Hello $name";
    }
    
    greet(prompt "What's your name? ");    # "Hello <name>"

This program will first prompt for a name, and whatever the user types in will be used as a parameter `$name` by the `greet` sub. (What `prompt` returns, `greet` will consume.)

In a lot of places, the parentheses are optional, and a matter of taste. This also works:

    greet prompt "What's your name? ";     # "Hello <name>"

It's up to you whether you think that's clearer of more confusing. `:-)`

The important thing to remember, if you *do* use parentheses, is that they should come directly after the sub name, without intervening space:

    add(4, 4);    # will work
    add (4, 4);   # will NOT work

Usually whitespace doesn't matter that much, but for sub calls (and things like indexings) it does matter.

There's a lot more to say about subroutines. But this will serve us for now.
